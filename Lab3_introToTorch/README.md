This lab deals with the basics of creating a NN using Pytorch

1. It starts with a basic introduction of tensors.
2. Introduction to gradients for a tensor
3. Backpropogation 
4. Finally updating parameters

It also contatins a basic 2 layer NN with first layer being fully connected relu and the second being another fully connected sigmoid.

The excercises at the end includes evaluating the current model on test data obtained after splitting the orginal data set and then creating a 3 layer NN and evaluate accuracy.
